# Running Zero EQ — Gatekeeper, SmartScreen and firewalls

macOS builds are signed and notarised, so they just open. The Windows
builds are unsigned and SmartScreen will object once. This page covers
that, the firewall prompts, and how to verify a download.

## Why the Windows builds are unsigned

macOS signing is covered: this project carries an Apple Developer Program
membership and a *Developer ID Application* certificate, and every macOS
artefact is notarised by Apple.

Windows is not. An Authenticode certificate (OV, or EV to skip building
SmartScreen reputation) runs ~$200-500/year, and the certificate authorities
will only issue one to a registered legal entity — which this project is not.
Nothing is wrong with the Windows downloads; Windows simply has no publisher
identity to check them against, so it assumes the worst once and then
remembers your answer.

## macOS — nothing to do

Every macOS artefact is Developer ID-signed, notarised by Apple and stapled,
so it opens on a double-click with no warning and no quarantine step. That
covers the nested helper binaries inside the bundle too, which is what the
old right-click-Open workaround never did.

To confirm it for yourself:

```sh
spctl -a -vv -t install "/Applications/<app>.app"
# accepted / source=Notarized Developer ID
```

## Windows — SmartScreen

**"Windows protected your PC — Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an
unrecognised app from starting."** Click **More info**, confirm the publisher line reads
*Unknown publisher*, then **Run anyway**.

To clear the mark-of-the-web before running instead — useful when the block is silent
rather than a prompt:

```powershell
Unblock-File .\<file>.exe
```

Or right-click the file → **Properties** → tick **Unblock** → **OK**. If you downloaded a
`.zip`, **unblock the `.zip` first, then extract** — otherwise every extracted file
inherits the flag and you'll be unblocking them one at a time.

### Defender antivirus false positives

Unsigned binaries that bundle a runtime occasionally get quarantined outright by
Defender's heuristics rather than merely warned about. If the download vanishes from
your Downloads folder, check **Windows Security → Virus & threat protection →
Protection history** and choose **Restore**. Add an exclusion for the install folder if
it keeps happening.

## Linux

No signing gate. Make the binary executable if you took the tarball:

```sh
chmod +x ./<binary>
```

The `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are unsigned too, so your package manager may object:
`sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb` or `sudo rpm -i --nosignature <file>.rpm`.

## Signing it yourself

### Windows — Authenticode

```powershell
signtool sign /fd SHA256 /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td SHA256 `
  /f mycert.pfx /p <password> .\<file>.exe
```

An OV certificate still needs to build SmartScreen reputation over time; an EV
certificate is trusted immediately. Neither is free.

## Verifying a download

Signing proves *who* built it; a checksum proves you got *what they built* — worth doing
even unsigned. Compare against the release notes:

```sh
shasum -a 256 <file>        # macOS / Linux
certutil -hashfile <file> SHA256   # Windows
```

You can also confirm the artifact came from this repo's CI by checking the release page it
was downloaded from — GitHub shows the workflow run that produced each asset.
